# Meta-Pattern Analysis Template

This document provides a systematic review of corrective actions to identify deeper patterns and structural improvements rather than addressing only symptoms.

## Implementation Prioritization

| Recommendation | Impact | Complexity | Urgency | Priority Score |
|----------------|--------|------------|---------|----------------|
| [Rec 1] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Score] |
| [Rec 2] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Score] |
| [Rec 3] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Score] |
| [Rec 4] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Score] |

## Simplicity Assessment

For each recommendation, answer:
- Does this recommendation reduce overall system complexity? [Yes/No]
- Does it address multiple patterns simultaneously? [Yes/No/Partially]
- Is it the minimal intervention needed to address the pattern? [Yes/No/Uncertain]
- Does it introduce essential or accumulative complexity? [Essential/Accumulative/None]
