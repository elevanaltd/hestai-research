# 02. Proven Insights

**Purpose**: Validated findings ready for application in implementations.

## Subdirectories

### `/breakthroughs/`
Major discoveries that changed the system:
- **odyssean-anchor/**: Constitutional paradox solution and SHANK-ARM-FLUKE validation (15 docs)

### `/patterns/`
Validated patterns for reuse:
- **pattern-learning/**: SPARK format, confidence metrics, emergent patterns (11 docs)

### `/metrics/`
Proven performance data and ROI evidence:
- **cost-analysis/**: 25-50x efficiency gains, 90% cost reduction evidence (12 docs)

## What Qualifies as "Proven"

Research graduates here when it has:
1. **Empirical validation** - Real data supporting claims
2. **Replication** - Consistent results across multiple tests
3. **Implementation readiness** - Clear application guidance
4. **ROI evidence** - Demonstrated value

## From Research to Implementation

Insights here inform the artifacts in `/03-implementation-ready/`. For example:
- Pattern learning insights → RAPH framework implementation
- Cost analysis → Model selection matrices
- Breakthrough discoveries → System architecture changes
