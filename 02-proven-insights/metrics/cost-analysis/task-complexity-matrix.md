# Task Complexity Matrix for HERMES Tiering
**RESEARCH STATUS**: FRAMEWORK INVALIDATED BY EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE  
**UPDATE DATE**: 2025-01-06  
**EVIDENCE SOURCE**: Comprehensive 11-test validation study

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: PARADIGM SHIFT REQUIRED

**Original framework based on task complexity assumptions DISPROVEN by research.**  
**Flash demonstrates Platinum+ capabilities across all tested categories.**

## EVIDENCE-BASED CLASSIFICATION (Updated)

### Volume Processing Tier (90% of HERMES work)
**Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (Non-Thinking)  
**Cost**: $0.60/1M tokens  
**Speed**: 33 seconds for comprehensive documents  
**Validated Capabilities**:
- ✅ Innovation leadership (LOGOS blind assessment #1)
- ✅ Technical architecture documentation  
- ✅ Complex pattern synthesis
- ✅ Strategic organizational design
- ✅ Original document creation
- ✅ Constitutional compliance analysis
- ✅ Cross-system integration planning
- ✅ System architecture documentation

### Professional Enhancement Tier (8% of HERMES work)  
**Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking Mode)  
**Cost**: $3.50/1M tokens  
**Speed**: 40.8 seconds for enhanced documents  
**Purpose**: Systematic organization and professional polish

### Strategic Refinement Tier (2% of HERMES work)
**Model**: Claude Sonnet 4/Opus  
**Cost**: $15-30/1M tokens (estimated)  
**Speed**: 150+ seconds  
**Purpose**: Elegant synthesis building on Flash innovations

## RESEARCH FINDINGS: ASSUMPTIONS vs REALITY

### Original Assessment Questions (INVALIDATED)
❌ **Complexity assumption**: More complexity = higher tier requirement  
❌ **Stakes assumption**: High stakes = premium model requirement  
❌ **Context assumption**: Background knowledge = cost correlation  
❌ **Creativity assumption**: Novel thinking = expensive processing  
❌ **Integration assumption**: System complexity = model tier requirement  

### Evidence-Based Evaluation Framework
✅ **Speed Requirement**: How quickly must this be completed?  
✅ **Volume Requirement**: How many similar tasks need processing?  
✅ **Polish Requirement**: Does this need systematic professional enhancement?  
✅ **Synthesis Requirement**: Does this need elegant refinement of Flash innovations?  
✅ **Cost Optimization**: What's the quality-per-dollar requirement?

### Validated Quality Performance
- **Flash Non-Thinking**: Innovation leadership, technical excellence, architectural mastery
- **Flash Thinking**: Professional systematic enhancement with 23% time increase
- **Opus**: Elegant synthesis and strategic refinement building on Flash foundation

## Implementation Protocol

**Default Route**: Flash Non-Thinking for ALL initial work  
**Enhancement Route**: Flash Thinking for professional deliverables  
**Refinement Route**: Opus for strategic synthesis and elegant refinement
