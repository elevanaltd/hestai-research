# Empirical Studies

This directory contains specific experiments and assessments that validated the theoretical insights.

## Key Studies

### logos-gemini-assessment.md
- **Purpose**: Direct comparison of Gemini and Claude responses to identical LOGOS prompts
- **Finding**: Gemini excels at systematic validation but struggles with creative synthesis
- **HestAI Impact**: Confirmed Gemini as optimal for ETHOS role, not LOGOS

### warp-cost-effectiveness-analysis.md
- **Purpose**: Analyze performance vs cost across different models for real tasks
- **Finding**: Strategic model selection can achieve 90% of performance at 10% of cost
- **HestAI Impact**: Informed the use of Claude Haiku for HERMES operational tasks

## Study Methodology

1. **Controlled Experiments** - Identical prompts across models
2. **Performance Metrics** - Task completion, accuracy, cost
3. **Qualitative Analysis** - Response style and cognitive approach
4. **Statistical Validation** - Ensuring findings are reproducible

## Key Takeaways

- Model selection matters more than prompt engineering for certain tasks
- Cost-effectiveness varies dramatically based on task-model alignment
- Empirical testing is essential - theoretical assumptions often prove wrong
