# HestAI Research Master Index

**Total Research Documents: 245**
**Last Updated: January 2025 (Post-HERMES Reorganization)**
**Note**: Count includes all markdown files; structure completely reorganized by HERMES

## Overview

This master index catalogs the comprehensive research corpus that traces the evolution from Thymos orchestral concepts through Daedalus workshop metaphors to the modern HestAI role-based system. HERMES has reorganized the research into clear categories that separate empirical evidence, operational guides, theoretical foundations, and system evolution timelines.

## Post-Reorganization Structure

The research is now organized into these major categories:
- **Empirical Studies** - Current validation research
- **Empirical Evidence/Validation Reports** - Structured validation studies  
- **Theoretical Foundations** - Core discoveries and frameworks
- **System Evolution** - Historical development timelines (Thymos→Daedalus→HestAI)
- **Operational Content** - Active tools, guides, and implementations
- **Specialized Research** - Cognitive architecture, cost analysis, pattern learning
