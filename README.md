# HestAI Research Foundation

**Status: Functional Reorganization Complete ✅**  
**Date: June 2025**  
**Research Items: 243 documents in workflow-based organization**

This repository contains the complete empirical research and theoretical foundations that trace the evolution from Thymos orchestral concepts through Daedalus workshop metaphors to the modern HestAI role-based system.

## Overview

The research documents represent a complete discovery journey spanning sophisticated AI collaboration, constitutional architectures, and empirical validation. Recently reorganized into a **workflow-based structure** that serves researchers, implementers, and decision makers by organizing content according to how it's actually used rather than just by topic.
