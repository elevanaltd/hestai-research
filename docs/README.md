# HestAI Research Documentation Structure

This directory contains organizational and meta-documentation for the HestAI research repository.

## Directory Structure

### `/docs/meta-research/`
Contains high-level organizational documents that help navigate and understand the research corpus:

- **MASTER_RESEARCH_INDEX.md** - Comprehensive index of all 136 research documents
- **EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md** - High-level overview of research findings
- **RESEARCH_GAP_ANALYSIS.md** - Identified gaps and future research priorities
- **NEXT_STEPS.md** - Actionable items based on research findings
- **daedalus-catalog.md** - Catalog of Daedalus project artifacts
- **hestai-thymos-catalog.md** - HestAI-Thymos integration catalog

## Research Categories

The actual research documents are organized in the parent directory by category:

1. **empirical-studies/** (18 docs) - Validation studies and performance metrics
2. **cognitive-architecture/** (18 docs) - AI cognitive models and frameworks
3. **cost-analysis/** (12 docs) - Cost-effectiveness and ROI analyses
4. **pattern-learning/** (11 docs) - Pattern discovery and evolution
5. **architectural-studies/** (34 docs) - System architecture and design
6. **user-research/** (12 docs) - UX studies and human-centered design
7. **raph-framework/** (9 docs) - Role-Agnostic Prompt Harmonization
8. **odyssean-anchor/** (14 docs) - SHANK-ARM-FLUKE breakthrough research
9. **database-architecture/** (2 docs) - Database technology evaluations
10. **evidence/** (5 docs) - Validation reports and benchmarks
11. **claude-code/** (2 docs) - Claude Code integration guides
12. **unverified-claims/** (1 doc) - Claims requiring validation

## Usage

- For a comprehensive overview, start with `meta-research/MASTER_RESEARCH_INDEX.md`
- To understand gaps and priorities, see `meta-research/RESEARCH_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
- For quick summaries, refer to `meta-research/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
- To find specific research, use the category directories in the parent folder

## Maintenance

When adding new research:
1. Place research documents in appropriate category directories
2. Update `meta-research/MASTER_RESEARCH_INDEX.md` with new entries
3. Note any new gaps in `meta-research/RESEARCH_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
4. Add actionable items to `meta-research/NEXT_STEPS.md` if applicable
