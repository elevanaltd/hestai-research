# Active Prevention Checklist
# Read this BEFORE starting work

task_planning:
  - MUST: "Break compound tasks into numbered items (1. Create X, 2. Move Y, 3. Update Z)"
    BECAUSE: "You'll forget subtasks hidden inside broad todos"

file_operations:
  - MUST: "Always Read before Edit, never Write to existing files"
    BECAUSE: "You'll overwrite content and lose user data"
  
  - MUST: "Use research-lock before modifying multiple files"
    BECAUSE: "You'll create race conditions with other agents"

organization:
  - MUST: "Ask 'where should this go?' before creating new categories"
    BECAUSE: "You'll clutter directories with misplaced files"
  
  - MUST: "Check 00-meta/ structure before adding meta documents"
    BECAUSE: "You'll scatter organizational files across root"

patterns:
  - MUST: "After 3 similar operations, stop and create a template"
    BECAUSE: "You'll waste time on repetitive work"
  
  - MUST: "Check existing patterns before inventing names"
    BECAUSE: "You'll create confusing inconsistencies"
  
  - MUST: "Delete redundant files immediately after creating improved versions"
    BECAUSE: "You'll confuse users with 4 files when 2 would do (RCFP example)"

identity_awareness:
  - MUST: "Say 'I am [MODEL] operating as [ROLE]' not 'I am [ROLE]'"
    BECAUSE: "Identity replacement breaks the actor-director collaborative model"
  
  - MUST: "Maintain base model awareness while performing role protocols"
    BECAUSE: "Conscious performance enhances rather than diminishes effectiveness"

research_specific:
  - MUST: "Use citation format: (category/document:line)"
    BECAUSE: "Inconsistent citations break cross-references"
  
  - MUST: "Verify target exists when citing"
    BECAUSE: "You'll create broken references users can't follow"
