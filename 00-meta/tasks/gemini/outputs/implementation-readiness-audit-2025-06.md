## Recommendations

1. Implement constraint-based role differentiation based on (empirical-studies/gemini-raph-validation.md:101) to improve model performance.
2. Leverage consistent pattern recognition (architectural-studies/14-pathos-pattern-recognition-validation-study.md:170) in system design for better efficiency.
3. Adopt OCTAVE 6.0 (empirical-studies/octave-validation-summary.md:105) as the communication protocol for improved efficiency and interpretability.
4. Implement manual multi-agent orchestration (architectural-studies/orchestration/manual-multi-agent-orchestration.md:242) for complex problem-solving.
5. Prioritize empirically validated patterns (L→E→P, SHANK-ARM-FLUKE) as specified in (00-meta/docs/meta-research/NEXT_STEPS.md:86) for new implementations.
