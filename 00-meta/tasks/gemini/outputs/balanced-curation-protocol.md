## Balanced Curation Protocol

ACTIVATE: [Role]
PROTOCOL: Content Curation
COGNITIVE MODE: RAPH
INSTRUCTION: Process the following six questions through full Read→Absorb→Perceive→Harmonize sequence to develop deep understanding of selection criteria:

1. "What are the 10 most foundational documents that establish core principles for your role within Thymos?"
2. "What 10 documents best demonstrate how your role relates to and integrates with other roles in the system?"
3. "What 10 documents contain the strongest empirical validation for your role's approach or the system as a whole?"
4. "What 10 documents provide the most essential practical implementation guidance for your domain?"
5. "What 10 documents are most critical for understanding threshold activation within your domain or the system overall?"
6. "What 10 documents contain the most important meta-patterns that should guide future evolution of the system?"

Rationale: The explicit questions and the use of RAPH to understand them is useful to have a framework for each stage
