## Implementation Approaches

The three implementation approaches:

1. Multi-Instance Specialized Architecture (Most Ambitious)
2. Task-Based Activation Framework (Balanced Approach)
3. Simplified Metaphorical Framework (Most Pragmatic)

Rationale: All approaches help you to decide between the 3, but the core of the most common one which should use, is the Task-Based Activation Framework. Also gives the user a good understanding of what is needed to select it
