# Research Tasks Directory

This directory organizes task assignments for various AI assistants and research projects.

## Structure

### Active Tasks
- `/gemini/` - Tasks for Gemini Flash research assistants
- Add new folders for other models/assistants as needed

### `/completed/`
Archive of completed tasks with results

## Task File Format

Each task file should include:
1. **Objective** - Clear goal
2. **Specific Instructions** - Step-by-step guidance
3. **Success Criteria** - How to measure completion
4. **Output Format** - Expected deliverable structure

## Current Active Tasks

### Gemini Flash Tasks
- `GEMINI_RESEARCH_TASKS.md` - Implementation readiness audit and cost validation

## Task Workflow

1. **Assignment**
   - Create task file in appropriate subfolder
   - Reference patterns from `/00-meta/activations/patterns/`
   - Set clear success criteria

2. **Execution**
   - Assistant works on task
   - Creates output in research directories
   - Uses research-lock for safety

3. **Completion**
   - Review deliverables
   - Move task file to `/completed/` with date
   - Update MASTER_RESEARCH_INDEX if needed

## Task Priorities

1. Implementation readiness audits
2. Cost model validations
3. Research-to-reality bridges
4. Contradiction hunting
5. Pattern extraction
