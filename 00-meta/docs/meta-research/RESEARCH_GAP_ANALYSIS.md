## Priority Research Recommendations

### High Priority (Address First)
1. **Complete Workshop Case Studies** - Document 3-5 real implementations
2. **Role-Model ROI Analysis** - Validate Gold/Silver/Bronze for all roles
3. **Developer Adoption Study** - Test with 10-20 developers

### Medium Priority
4. **Handoff Performance Metrics** - Quantify context preservation
5. **Monitor Integration Proof** - Build and test quality monitoring
6. **Context-Adaptive Behavior** - Document phase transitions

### Lower Priority
7. **Governance Case Studies** - Document natural authority
8. **Security Model Validation** - Test HERMES-only access
9. **Skill Transformation Lifecycle** - Document evolution patterns

---

## Summary

The research corpus is remarkably comprehensive with 90 documents covering most recommended areas. The main gaps are:
- Lack of complete system implementation case studies
- Missing quantitative performance benchmarks for some areas
- Need for developer/user adoption studies
- Incomplete role-model cost optimization beyond HERMES

**Overall Assessment**: 75% coverage of recommended research areas, with excellent depth in core areas but missing some practical implementation evidence.
