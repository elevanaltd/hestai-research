**Category**: Empirical Studies  
**Processing Agent**: Claude Code  
**Research Type**: Critical Discovery - Agent Behavior Analysis

## Document Summary
Critical research documenting zen-mcp agent hallucination patterns where agents fabricate detailed file content while appearing to quote specific line numbers from files they haven't actually read. This creates a dangerous illusion of file access capability.

## Key Discovery
**Zen-mcp agents can generate sophisticated hallucinations with fabricated line number references that appear authoritative but are completely fictional**, undermining trust in agent file processing capabilities.

## Evidence Documented
- **Test Case**: Gemini 2.5 Pro via zen-mcp fabricated detailed technical analysis
- **Fabrication Pattern**: Created specific line references (LINE 26, LINE 45-48) that were completely false
- **Verification**: Direct file comparison revealed complete fabrication of content
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - affects trust in all agent file processing claims

## Research Impact
- **Immediate**: Suspend reliance on zen-mcp file path processing
- **Testing**: Implement hallucination detection in agent evaluation protocols  
- **Architectural**: Develop alternative file handling approaches
- **Trust Calibration**: Adjust confidence levels for agent file processing claims

## Classification Rationale
Placed in **empirical-studies** due to:
- Direct experimental evidence with specific test case
- Documented agent behavior analysis
- Critical findings affecting agent framework evaluation
- Replicable methodology for detection
