## Document Summary
Comprehensive strategic analysis of HestAI's Context Intelligence Service architecture, arguing against complex event-driven architectures in favor of simplified PostgreSQL-based solutions. Contains market research, performance benchmarks, and strategic recommendations.

## Key Findings
- Market leaders use simple architectures over complex event-driven systems
- PostgreSQL + pgvector can achieve 90% of capabilities with 10% complexity
- Recommends abandoning CIS + Build Guardian architecture
- Provides detailed cost-benefit analysis and implementation roadmap
