## Document Summary
Analysis of LLM agent loading strategies examining the failure modes of "eager loading" versus the benefits of "just-in-time (JIT) loading" with mandatory pre-execution checklists. Addresses critical architectural questions about how agents should load operational knowledge.

## Key Findings
- **Eager loading** (loading all referenced documents at startup) is detrimental to agent performance
- **JIT loading** with pre-execution checklists is optimal strategy
- Core problem: capability possession ≠ capability application
- Context window dilution reduces focus and role adherence
- Mandatory pre-execution checklist ensures consistent capability application

## Classification Rationale
Placed in **cognitive-architecture/odyssean-anchor** due to:
- Analysis of agent cognitive behavior and memory management
- Loading protocols and capability application mechanisms
- Architectural recommendations for agent design
- Related to HERMES operational frameworks

## Related Research
- Connects to Odyssean Anchor cognitive architecture research
- Links to HERMES loading templates and operational directives
- Supports agent capability management strategies
