## Strategic Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: SmartSuite
**Rationale**: Best balance of integrated document management, automated project coordination, and adaptability to chaotic workflows.

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Prototype Setup**: Create Solution with Scenes table (SmartDocs) linked to Shots table
2. **Dependency Testing**: Configure Gantt view with auto-scheduling validation
3. **External Collaboration**: Test guest account workflow for stakeholder feedback
4. **Template Development**: Customize for specific workflow patterns

### Alternative Recommendations

**If External Collaboration is Critical**: Monday.com or Notion
- Monday.com for PM-focused workflows with public Workdocs
- Notion for content-centric workflows with seamless external editing

**If Maximum Customization Needed**: Coda
- Requires technical team member comfortable with formula/automation setup
- Provides most flexible custom workflow development

**If Simplicity is Paramount**: Monday.com or Basecamp
- Monday.com for structured project management
- Basecamp for communication-focused coordination

## Implementation Considerations

### Success Factors
1. **Training Investment**: Team adoption within 1 week requires guided setup
2. **Template Configuration**: Leverage SmartSuite's creative pipeline templates
3. **Integration Planning**: Consider API connections for existing tool ecosystem
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track mobile app performance on project scale

### Risk Mitigation
1. **External Collaboration**: Develop guest account workflow or hybrid approach
2. **Platform Maturity**: Monitor feature development and stability
3. **Vendor Lock-in**: Ensure data export capabilities for migration flexibility
4. **Cost Scaling**: Evaluate pricing impact as team/project volume grows
