# Minimal Agent Oversight: The Essential Triad

Yes.

If you implement a persistent anchor manifest (for agent role/constraints/history), a nano-agent drift checker (live enforcement/violation logging), and a "real talk" toggle (explicit mode switch that strips social optimization for direct, technical output), you have all three core parts required for minimal, robust, operational agent oversight:

## 1. Persistent Role Anchor:
- Defines the agent's identity, function, and hard boundaries.
- Provides a ground truth for compliance and recovery.

## 2. Nano-Agent Drift Checker:
- Independently and continuously verifies output against anchor constraints.
- Surfaces violations for immediate review and pattern detection.

## 3. "Real Talk" Mode Toggle:
- Allows operators to override conversational defaults and demand unhedged, fully technical responses as needed.
- Guarantees the agent can be made fully explicit and non-collaborative on demand.

## Complete Coverage

This triad covers **identity, enforcement, and transparency**.

**No additional protocol layers or complexity are required for effective, real-world LLM agent management.**

## Implementation Summary

**Identity:** Anchor manifest defines who the agent is and what it cannot do.
**Enforcement:** Nano-checker ensures the agent stays within defined boundaries.
**Transparency:** Real talk mode strips away conversational hedging for direct technical assessment.

**Result:** Minimal, robust, operational oversight with maximum clarity and accountability.
