# References

This directory contains operational guidance derived from research findings.

## Key Document

### model-role-capability-matrix.md (symlink)
- **Location**: Links to `/hestai-system/config/foundation/model-role-capability-matrix.md`
- **Purpose**: Practical mapping of models to roles based on empirical testing
- **Usage**: Primary reference for model selection in HestAI implementations

## Why a Symlink?

The model-role capability matrix is both:
- A research output (belongs here conceptually)
- An operational document (needed in the HestAI system)

The symlink ensures both projects reference the same authoritative source.

## Matrix Insights

The capability matrix synthesizes:
- Cognitive architecture discoveries
- Empirical performance data
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Practical implementation experience

## Using the Matrix

1. **For Role Assignment** - Check which models excel at each role
2. **For Model Selection** - Choose models based on task requirements
3. **For System Design** - Understand capability boundaries
