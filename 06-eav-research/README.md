# 06-EAV-Research: Extended Analysis & Validation

**Purpose**: Advanced research requiring extended analysis, validation, and investigation beyond standard research categories.

**Status**: New category (July 2025)

## Overview

This directory contains research that requires:
- Extended multi-step analysis workflows
- Complex validation with multiple data sources
- In-depth investigation requiring systematic methodology
- Advanced research patterns not covered by standard categories

## Research Types

### Extended Analysis
- Complex multi-factor research requiring systematic investigation
- Cross-domain analysis requiring deep exploration
- Research requiring multiple validation steps and evidence synthesis

### Advanced Validation
- Empirical studies requiring extended validation protocols
- Multi-model comparative analysis requiring systematic methodology
- Research requiring comprehensive evidence collection and synthesis

### Investigative Research
- Research requiring systematic investigation and evidence gathering
- Complex problem analysis requiring structured methodology
- Studies requiring multiple research phases and validation steps

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use This Category
- Research requiring multiple investigation phases
- Studies needing systematic evidence collection
- Analysis requiring extended validation protocols
- Complex research not fitting standard empirical/theoretical categories

## Integration with HestAI System

This research category supports:
- Advanced role-based research methodologies
- Extended validation of HestAI system components
- Complex analysis requiring systematic investigation
- Research requiring multiple cognitive approaches (LOGOS, ETHOS, PATHOS)

## Contributing

Follow standard research contribution guidelines:
1. Use appropriate subdirectory based on research type
2. Maintain systematic investigation protocols
3. Document evidence chains and validation steps
4. Follow HestAI citation and cross-reference standards
