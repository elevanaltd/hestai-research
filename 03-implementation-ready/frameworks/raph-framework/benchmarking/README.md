# RAPH Benchmarking Evidence

This directory contains empirical validation of the RAPH framework across different models and use cases.

## Key Studies

### raph-benchmarking-evidence.md
- **Core Finding**: Sequential loading improves task performance by 40-60%
- **Method**: Controlled experiments comparing RAPH vs traditional prompting
- **Models Tested**: Claude (Opus, Sonnet), GPT-4, Gemini
- **Key Metric**: Task completion accuracy and coherence scores

### raph-constraint-effects.md
- **Core Finding**: Constraint placement in Phase 3 optimizes compliance without limiting creativity
- **Method**: A/B testing of constraint introduction at different phases
- **Impact**: Informed the placement of governance protocols in HestAI

### gemini-raph-validation.md
- **Core Finding**: RAPH principles apply across architecturally different models
- **Method**: Replication of RAPH protocol on Gemini models
- **Significance**: Proves RAPH is a general principle, not model-specific

### raph-mini-costing.md
- **Core Finding**: 90% performance achievable at 10% token cost
- **Method**: Token usage analysis across different loading strategies
- **Business Impact**: Makes sophisticated AI systems economically viable

## Benchmarking Methodology

1. **Baseline Establishment** - Traditional monolithic prompting performance
2. **RAPH Implementation** - Same content delivered via 6-phase protocol
3. **Metrics Collection** - Task accuracy, coherence, token usage
4. **Statistical Validation** - Ensuring results are reproducible

## Key Performance Indicators

- **Comprehension**: +45% average improvement
- **Task Adherence**: +38% improvement in following complex instructions
- **Role Consistency**: +52% improvement in maintaining identity
- **Token Efficiency**: 10x improvement in cost per quality point

## Validation Across Domains
