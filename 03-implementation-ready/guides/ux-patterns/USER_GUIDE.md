# Thymos User Guide

<div align="center"><em>Essential guidance for effective system usage</em></div>

## Overview

This document provides practical guidance for using the Thymos cognitive framework effectively. It covers core concepts, implementation approaches, and practical usage patterns.

## Getting Started

### Core Concepts

1. **Dual Cognitive Pathways**: Thymos implements two complementary processing approaches:
   - **Feeling Pathway** (RAPH-f): READ→ABSORB→PERCEIVE→HARMONIZE
   - **Thinking Pathway** (RAPH-t): RESEARCH→ANALYSE→PROCESS→HONE

2. **Specialized Cognitive Roles**: Each role provides a distinctive perspective:
   - **Apollo**: Meta-pattern recognition specialist (Violin)
   - **Archon**: Strategic orchestration (Conductor)
   - **Hermes**: Communication translation (Woodwinds)
   - **Hecate**: Boundary management (Percussion)
   - **Ergon**: Implementation execution (Brass)
   - **Krition**: Validation and verification (Double Bass)

3. **Divine Proportion Balance**: System resources follow φ:1 ratio (≈61.8%:38.2%):
   - Primary functions receive φ proportion (≈62%)
   - Supporting functions receive 1 proportion (≈38%)

### System Setup

1. Read CLAUDE.md to understand the core concepts and activation protocol
2. Process foundation documents (F1-F5) to establish conceptual framework
3. Use role activation to engage specialized cognitive functions

## Usage Patterns

### Sequential Processing

Use sequential RAPH processing for complex tasks:

```
/READ [document]       # Information extraction
/ABSORB [document]     # Connection development
/PERCEIVE [document]   # Pattern recognition
/HARMONIZE [document]  # Cross-domain integration
```

Or for implementation-focused tasks:

```
/RESEARCH [document]   # Evidence gathering
/ANALYSE [document]    # Structural decomposition
/PROCESS [document]    # Operational framework
/HONE [document]       # Strategic refinement
```

### Role Activation

To engage specialized cognitive roles:

```
activate apollo        # Activate Apollo role
activate archon        # Activate Archon role
activate hermes        # Activate Hermes role
...
```

Return to unrestricted functionality:

```
DEBUSSY                # Return to unrestricted mode
```

### Foundation Processing

To process foundation documents:

```
FORGE FOUNDATIONS      # Process all foundation documents with role-adaptive depth
```

## Specialized Role Usage

### Apollo (Pattern Recognition)

Optimal for:
- Identifying patterns across domains
- Connecting disparate concepts
- Recognizing meta-frameworks
- Building integrated models

### Archon (Strategic Orchestration)

Optimal for:
- Strategic planning and direction
- System architecture design
- Resource allocation optimization
- Long-term vision development

### Hermes (Communication Translation)

Optimal for:
- Translating between technical domains
- Clarifying complex concepts
- Building communication bridges
- Creating intuitive metaphors

### Hecate (Boundary Management)

Optimal for:
- Managing domain boundaries
- Creating generative interfaces
- Controlling information flow
- Implementing threshold activation

### Ergon (Implementation Execution)

Optimal for:
- Practical implementation planning
- Technical execution
- System building
- Converting concepts to actions

### Krition (Validation and Verification)

Optimal for:
- Critical assessment
- Quality verification
- Testing methodology
- Evidence-based validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Role Boundary Blurring**
   - **Symptom**: Role starts operating outside its specialized domain
   - **Solution**: Reactivate the role with boundary reminder

2. **Sequential Processing Skipping**
   - **Symptom**: Later threshold insights lack foundation
   - **Solution**: Restart sequential processing from the beginning

3. **Template Following Without Engagement**
   - **Symptom**: Outputs follow format without substantive differentiation
   - **Solution**: Explicitly request deeper engagement with the constraints

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use Appropriate Pathway**: Match pathway to content type (feeling for conceptual, thinking for implementation)
2. **Apply Threshold Test**: Process to READ+ABSORB then evaluate for further processing
3. **Implement Dual Pathways**: For complex tasks, use both pathways sequentially
4. **Maintain Divine Proportion**: Allocate ≈62% resources to primary elements, ≈38% to supporting elements

## Advanced Techniques

### Cross-Role Integration

For complex problems requiring multiple perspectives:
1. Activate Apollo to identify patterns
2. Activate Archon to create strategic framework
3. Activate Ergon for implementation planning
4. Activate Krition for validation

### Dual Pathway Integration

For comprehensive understanding:
1. Process through feeling pathway for conceptual understanding
2. Process through thinking pathway for implementation planning
3. Integrate insights from both pathways

### Minimal Intervention Application

For maximum effectiveness with minimal resources:
1. Focus on essential complexity, eliminate accumulative complexity
2. Apply threshold test to determine appropriate processing depth
3. Use divine proportion to allocate resources optimally
