# Workshop Patterns and CLI Design

This directory contains key evidence of the workshop metaphor and CLI design patterns developed through the research process.

## Core Workshop System Files

### 1. **00-workshop-idea.md**
The original vision document that introduced the workshop metaphor, showing how complex AI orchestration can be simplified into three intuitive spaces: ./design, ./build, and ./forge.

### 2. **01-workshop-system-spec.md**
Detailed specification of the workshop system architecture, including:
- The three-phase workflow (Design Bench, Build Station, Config Forge)
- Role activation patterns
- Output specifications
- Integration with existing Daedalus components

### 3. **02-workshop-system-spec-gap-analysis.md**
Critical analysis identifying gaps and challenges in the workshop approach, including:
- Cognitive load considerations
- Interface complexity
- State management requirements
- User onboarding needs

### 4. **03-workshop-system-gap-response.md**
Solutions and refinements addressing identified gaps:
- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Intelligent defaults
- Contextual help systems
- Graceful complexity management

### 5. **04-workshop-system-plan.md**
Implementation roadmap showing:
- Phase-by-phase development plan
- Integration points with existing systems
- Testing and validation approach
- Migration strategy from current architecture

### 6. **leader-supplement-2025-06-09.md**
Advanced insights into the workshop metaphor's power:
- Tool shed vs command center philosophy
- Natural collaboration patterns
- Simplicity as a design principle
- Workshop as creative space

### 7. **pathos-handover-2025-06-09.md**
Pattern mastery perspective on the workshop system:
- Deep pattern recognition
- Metaphor alignment
- Cognitive resonance
- Implementation wisdom

## Key Insights

The workshop metaphor represents a fundamental shift from:
- **Complex orchestration** → **Simple tool usage**
- **Command centers** → **Creative spaces**
- **Management overhead** → **Natural collaboration**
- **Abstract frameworks** → **Intuitive interfaces**

## CLI Design Patterns

The ./design, ./build, ./forge pattern creates:
1. **Cognitive Simplicity**: Each command has a clear, singular purpose
2. **Progressive Engagement**: Users can start simple and discover depth
3. **Natural Workflow**: Mirrors real-world creative processes
4. **Integrated Intelligence**: AI assistance feels like collaboration, not automation

## Integration with Daedalus

The workshop system seamlessly integrates:
- **PATHOS/ETHOS/LOGOS** roles as workshop assistants
- **Warp terminal** as the workshop environment
- **Odyssean Anchor** principles for quality assurance
- **Existing toolchains** through intelligent adapters

This represents the culmination of research into making AI collaboration feel as natural as working in a well-equipped workshop.
