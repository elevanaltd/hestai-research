# Evidence Directory

This directory contains supporting materials for research claims that require empirical validation.

## Evidence Standards

### Required Documentation
1. **Data Collection Methods**: How measurements were taken
2. **Sample Specifications**: Size, scope, timeframe
3. **Measurement Tools**: Software, scripts, validation methods
4. **Analysis Procedures**: Statistical methods, calculations
5. **External Validation**: Independent verification where possible

### File Naming Convention
- `claim-[category]-[date].md` - Evidence document
- `data-[category]-[date].csv` - Raw data
- `methodology-[category].md` - Testing procedures
- `validation-[category]-[verifier].md` - External verification

## Claim Restoration Process

1. **Evidence Submission**: Place supporting files in appropriate subdirectory
2. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all required elements present
3. **Verification**: Independent review of methodology and data
4. **Citation Update**: Add proper evidence links to original claim
5. **Restoration**: Move validated claim back to main research directory

## Evidence Quality Tiers

### Tier 1: Fully Validated
- Complete methodology documentation
- Adequate sample size
- External verification
- Reproducible results

### Tier 2: Internally Validated  
- Clear methodology
- Reasonable sample size
- Internal consistency checks
- Awaiting external verification

### Tier 3: Preliminary Evidence
- Basic documentation
- Limited sample size
- Requires additional validation
- Observational findings

Claims must reach Tier 2 minimum before restoration to main research.
