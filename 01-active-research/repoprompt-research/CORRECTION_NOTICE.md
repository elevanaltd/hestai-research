# CORRECTION NOTICE: RepoPrompt Research

## Critical Error Identified
Date: 2025-07-06
Identified by: User feedback
Error: Conflation of two separate projects with similar names

## Correction

### These are TWO DIFFERENT PROJECTS:

1. **RepoPrompt** (capital R, capital P)
   - Website: https://repoprompt.com/
   - Type: Commercial macOS application
   - Developer: Unknown (not mhallsmoore)
   - Features: PLAN/ACT modes, advanced workflow management
   - Business model: Freemium

2. **repoprompt** (lowercase)
   - Repository: https://github.com/mhallsmoore/repoprompt
   - Type: Open-source Python library
   - Developer: mhallsmoore
   - Features: Basic repository-to-prompt conversion
   - License: MIT

## Research Error
The original research incorrectly treated these as two components of the same ecosystem (commercial app + open-source library) when they are actually:
- Separate projects
- Different developers
- No apparent connection beyond similar names and general purpose

## Impact on Analysis
- Strategic analysis incorrectly assumed coordinated ecosystem
- Technical specifications mixed two unrelated projects
- Competitive analysis may have incorrect assumptions
- Integration recommendations need revision

## Required Updates
All research documents need revision to:
1. Clearly separate the two projects
2. Remove assumptions about ecosystem coordination
3. Update strategic analysis accordingly
4. Correct technical specifications
