# RepoPrompt macOS App Research Collection

## Research Overview
Comprehensive research and analysis of the RepoPrompt macOS application conducted on 2025-07-06 by HERMES (Claude operating as System Steward) for HestAI strategic assessment.

**Important Note**: This research has been corrected to focus exclusively on the RepoPrompt macOS application. A previous version incorrectly conflated RepoPrompt with an unrelated Python library called "repoprompt" by mhallsmoore.

## Research Scope
- **Primary Subject**: RepoPrompt macOS application
- **Research Depth**: Feature analysis, workflow patterns, strategic assessment
- **Methodology**: Web research, review analysis, competitive comparison
- **Purpose**: Understanding for HestAI differentiation and strategic positioning
