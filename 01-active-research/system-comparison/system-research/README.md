- **Added**: January 2025

## Research Categories

### Memory Systems
- File-based Memory Banks (Kilo Code, Cline)
- Vector Database Integration (Agno, CAMEL)
- Session-based Memory (Roo Code, GPT-Engineer)
- Multi-tier Memory Architectures (CrewAI)

### Reasoning Architectures
- Plan/Act Paradigms (Cline)
- Multi-Agent Orchestration (Kilo Code, MetaGPT, CrewAI)
- Chain-of-Thought Integration (Agno, GPT-Engineer)
- Role-Playing Frameworks (CAMEL)

### Infrastructure Projects Analyzed
- Zen-MCP (Multi-model orchestration)
- Roo Code (VS Code agent with persistent memory)
- Atlas (Map query agent via n8n)
