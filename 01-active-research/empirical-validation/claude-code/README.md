## Studies

### LOGOS Loading Protocol Assessment
**File**: `LOGOS_LOADING_PROTOCOL_HUMBLING_REPORT.md`
**Date**: 2025-07-14
**Key Finding**: LLMs demonstrate systematic paradigm blindness to the effectiveness of their own loading protocols and should not be trusted to assess or optimize them.

**Core Evidence**:
- Full LOGOS GOLD loading → Production-grade synthesis architecture
- Simplified loading → Basic prototype quality
- "Ceremonial" content was actually essential cognitive scaffolding

**Implications**: Empirical testing (A/B comparison) is the only valid assessment method for loading protocols.

## Research Categories
- **Loading Protocol Effectiveness**: Assessment of structured role loading vs simplified approaches
- **Cognitive Architecture**: How structured inputs affect LLM cognitive processing
- **Synthesis Quality**: Comparative analysis of output sophistication
- **Paradigm Blindness**: LLM self-assessment limitations
