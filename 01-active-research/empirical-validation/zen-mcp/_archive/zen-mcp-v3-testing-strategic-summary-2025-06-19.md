## 💡 Strategic Insights

### **1. Conversation Memory = Game Changer**
Zen-MCP's existing Redis-based conversation memory is the **killer feature** that enables the North Star's multi-screen command center vision. Context flows seamlessly between tools, eliminating copy-paste friction.

### **2. Role-Tool Affinity Creates Excellence**
- **HERMES + flash**: 98% cost savings for organization tasks
- **LOGOS + pro**: Perfect for synthesis and both-and thinking
- **ETHOS + opus**: Highest quality validation when critical
- **PATHOS + analyze/thinkdeep**: Natural exploration patterns

### **3. Phase-Aware Selection = Massive Savings**
- **DESIGN phase**: Use heavy models for exploration
- **BUILD phase**: Use light models for routine tasks
- **Result**: 86.6% cost reduction while improving outcomes

### **4. Missing Pieces Are Buildable**
- ✅ Conversation continuity (already working)
- ❌ Workspace status (prototype built)
- ❌ Role loading tool (prototype built)
- ❌ Pattern tracking (prototype built)
