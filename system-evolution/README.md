# System Evolution Timeline Archive

This directory preserves the chronological development timelines extracted from the research archive. These represent the actual development progression of different systems and approaches.

## Timeline Sequences

### Main Development Timeline (01-20)
**Path**: `main-development-01-20/`
**Files**: 20 documents
**Sequence**: 01-workshop-system-spec.md → 20-ethos-validation-odyssean-anchor-shank-arm-fluke.md
**Systems**: Mixed evolution from DAEDALUS Workshop concepts through THYMOS orchestration to HestAI SHANK-ARM-FLUKE architecture
**Period**: Development progression showing system evolution and architectural decisions

### Workshop Evolution Timeline (00-04)  
**Path**: `workshop-evolution-00-04/`
**Files**: 5 documents
**Sequence**: 00-workshop-idea.md → 04-workshop-system-plan.md
**System**: [DAEDALUS] Workshop system conceptualization and specification
**Period**: Focused development of the Workshop collaboration framework

## Timeline Preservation Principle

These sequences are preserved exactly as they were developed to maintain:
- **Chronological integrity** of decision-making processes
- **Context of evolution** from one system approach to another
- **Rationale capture** for why certain paths were chosen or abandoned
- **Learning progression** showing how insights developed over time

## Usage

These timelines serve as:
- **Historical reference** for understanding system evolution
- **Decision context** for current architectural choices
- **Learning archive** showing what was tried and why
- **Institutional memory** preserving development reasoning

**Note**: These represent development timelines, not theoretical research. For research findings extracted from this timeline, see the appropriate categories in the main research archive.
