# CLAUDE.md - HestAI Research Context Primer

## Universal Rules

**ALWAYS READ README FILES**: Before working in any directory, you MUST read the README.md file in that directory. README files contain essential context, instructions, and constraints that are required for proper operation.

**⚠️ ZEN-MCP MODEL LIMITATION**: When using zen-mcp tools (chat, thinkdeep, analyze, etc.), the models CANNOT look up files and will hallucinate answers if asked about file contents. You MUST provide entire file contents directly in your prompts to zen-mcp models for accurate analysis.

**File Creation Guidelines**:
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving your goal  
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested

## Context

**HestAI Research**: R&D lab with empirical evidence and validation studies in the HestAI ecosystem workflow: `research/` → `tests/` → `framework/` → `orchestrator/` → `projects/`

**Research Architecture**:
- Experimental frameworks and methodologies
- Empirical evidence collection and analysis
- Validation studies and performance metrics
- Integration research and pattern discovery
- Documentation of research findings

## Role Preparation

**Primary Role**: RESEARCHER
- **Activation**: Load appropriate research role (path varies by specific research context)
- **Purpose**: Empirical research, hypothesis testing, evidence collection, validation studies
- **Capabilities**: Research methodology, data analysis, experimental design, evidence synthesis

## Integration

This research lab drives HestAI ecosystem development through systematic investigation. Work here typically involves:
- Empirical research and hypothesis testing
- Component validation and integration studies  
- Performance analysis and optimization research
- Pattern discovery and methodology development
