# Discovery Patterns: What We're Looking For

**Document Type:** Pattern Recognition Guide  
**Status:** [PATTERNS_IDENTIFIED|EVOLVING_DOCUMENT]  
**Created:** 2025-01-30  
**Purpose:** Document what to watch for during testing

## Core Discovery Areas

We're not just finding which model fits which role. We're discovering:
- How different cognitive architectures express the same function
- What unexpected capabilities emerge from model-role combinations
- How models naturally complement each other in orchestration
- Where our assumptions about models prove wrong

## Model Personality Patterns

### Cognitive Fingerprints

**Systematic vs Intuitive**
- Some models enumerate options methodically
- Others leap to creative connections
- Both can succeed at pattern recognition differently

**Verbose vs Concise**
- Natural tendencies toward explanation depth
- Some models show through examples
- Others explain through principles

**Concrete vs Abstract**
- Preference for practical examples vs philosophical frameworks
- Different abstraction comfort levels
- Varying metaphor usage patterns

### Expression Styles

**Opening Patterns**
- How models begin their responses
- Confidence vs exploration tones
- Direct vs warming-up approaches

**Transition Mechanisms**
- How models move between ideas
- Connection-making styles
- Flow between concepts

**Conclusion Tendencies**
- Summary vs open-ended
- Call-to-action vs reflection
- Closure vs continuation

- Theoretical frameworks

**The Practical PATHOS**
- Real-world pattern examples
- Concrete applications
- Actionable insights

**The Poetic PATHOS**
- Metaphor-rich expression
- Artistic connections
- Emotional resonance

### ETHOS Variations

**The Guardian ETHOS**
- Protective boundary enforcement
- Risk-focused evaluation
- Safety-first approach

**The Enabler ETHOS**
- Constraints as guidelines
- Focus on what's possible
- Boundary optimization

**The Architect ETHOS**
- Structural constraint focus
- System-level boundaries
- Design principles

### LOGOS Variations

**The Innovator LOGOS**
- Breakthrough synthesis
- Novel combinations
- Creative solutions

**The Engineer LOGOS**
- Systematic construction

## Collaboration Patterns

### Natural Handoff Affinities

**Smooth Transitions**
Watch for model outputs that naturally set up the next role:
- PATHOS outputs that clearly frame constraints needed
- ETHOS outputs that inspire synthesis approaches
- LOGOS outputs that integrate both perspectives

**Cognitive Resonance**
Some model pairs may show special chemistry:
- Complementary thinking styles
- Natural conversation flow
- Enhanced combined output

**Style Matching**
- Similar abstraction levels
- Compatible verbosity
- Aligned expression patterns

### Friction Points

**Style Clashes**
- Abstract PATHOS to concrete ETHOS
- Verbose to concise transitions
- Philosophical to practical jumps

**Assumption Gaps**
- Different baseline knowledge
- Varying context needs
- Incompatible frameworks

## Unexpected Capabilities

### Emergent Behaviors

**Role Transcendence**
Models showing capabilities beyond role boundaries:
- ETHOS that inspires vision
- PATHOS that self-constrains
- LOGOS that generates new patterns

**Hidden Strengths**
Discovering unknown model capabilities:
- Unexpected philosophical depth
- Surprising technical precision
- Unrealized creative potential

**Composite Abilities**
What emerges when specific model-role combinations occur:
- New synthesis approaches
- Novel pattern recognition
- Unique constraint navigation

### Limitation Patterns

**Consistent Weaknesses**
- Repeated boundary violations
- Persistent blind spots
- Structural limitations

**Context Dependencies**
- Performance varies with prompt style
- Different success with different domains
- Sensitivity to framing

---

## Assumption Violations

### Reputation vs Reality

**"Premium" Model Surprises**
- When expensive models underperform
- Where "advanced" doesn't mean "better"
- How context changes everything

**"Basic" Model Excellence**
- When simpler models excel
- Where constraints boost performance
- How specialization beats generalization

### Bias Discovery

**Our Hidden Assumptions**
- What we expect from each platform
- How brand affects perception
- Where we've been limiting models

**Model Self-Limitations**
- Unnecessary humility
- Imposed constraints
- Artificial boundaries

---

## System-Level Discoveries

### Orchestration Insights

**Optimal Sequences**
Track which flows work best:
- Problem type → Model sequence mapping
- Discovery of natural rhythms
- Efficient handoff patterns

**Parallel Possibilities**
- When multiple PATHOS perspectives help
- Where competing ETHOS views clarify
- How parallel LOGOS attempts complement

### Evolution Patterns

**Role Enrichment**
How testing expands role definitions:
- New valid expressions discovered
- Boundaries clarified through violation
- Capabilities revealed through practice

**System Maturation**
- How the testing system improves itself
- What patterns become clearer over time
- Where efficiency emerges

---

## Documentation Priorities

### Always Capture

**Surprises**
- "I didn't expect Model X to..."
- "This changes how I think about..."
- "We should explore this further..."

**Contradictions**
- When results oppose assumptions
- Where models break patterns
- How exceptions prove illuminating

**Insights**
- "This means we could..."
- "I now understand why..."
- "The pattern here is..."

### Pattern Evolution

This document grows through discovery:
- New pattern categories emerge
- Existing patterns refine
- Understanding deepens

Each test session should add to this knowledge base, building our understanding of how different intelligences express themselves and work together.

## Using These Patterns

### During Testing
- Watch for these patterns actively
- Note variations and surprises
- Document immediately

### During Analysis
- Compare against known patterns
- Identify new patterns
- Update this guide

### During Implementation
- Use patterns to guide selection
- Leverage discovered strengths
- Avoid confirmed weaknesses

*Discovery is not about confirming what we know, but about finding what we don't know we don't know. These patterns guide our attention while remaining open to surprise.*
