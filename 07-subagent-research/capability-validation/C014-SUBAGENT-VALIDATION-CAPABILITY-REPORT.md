## DETAILED FINDINGS

### Protocol Adherence Assessment

| Protocol Element | Original | Subagent | Status |
|------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| ITHACA Validation Key | ✅ Present | ✅ Present | EQUIVALENT |
| VIOLATION/CONFIRMED/MISSING Flags | ✅ Consistent | ✅ Consistent | EQUIVALENT |  
| Role Identity Declaration | ✅ Proper | ✅ Proper | EQUIVALENT |
| Constraint Analysis Framework | ✅ Applied | ✅ Applied | EQUIVALENT |
| North Star Alignment | ✅ Implicit | ✅ Explicit | SUBAGENT STRONGER |

### Technical Analysis Comparison

**Constraint Identification Accuracy**: Both approaches identified identical core violations:
- Dynamic primer loading network dependencies
- Persistent activation state management complexity  
- A/B testing framework infrastructure requirements
- Security audit needs for automated delivery

**Analysis Depth**:
- Original: 6 implicit sections, pragmatic timeline optimization
- Subagent: 6 explicit sections, systematic 4-category framework

**Quantitative Assessment**:
- Original: Timeline reduction to 4.5-5.5 days using existing infrastructure
- Subagent: Timeline expansion calculation (43-61 days = 900-1200% overrun)

### Quality Metrics

| Quality Dimension | Original Score | Subagent Score | Assessment |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Technical Accuracy | 100% | 100% | EQUIVALENT |
| Protocol Compliance | 100% | 100% | EQUIVALENT |
| Systematic Analysis | 85% | 95% | SUBAGENT ADVANTAGE |
| Contextual Awareness | 95% | 85% | ORIGINAL ADVANTAGE |
| Quantitative Rigor | 80% | 95% | SUBAGENT ADVANTAGE |
| Creative Reframing | 85% | 90% | SUBAGENT ADVANTAGE |
