# Theoretical Research Frameworks

This directory contains conceptual frameworks and assessments relevant to the THYMOS and DAEDALUS systems. These documents provide rationales, metaphor systems, and critical evaluations of role models used during system evolution.

## Key Frameworks and Assessments

- Apollo and Hermes Orchestral Role Analyses (THYMOS)
- Orchestral Framework Specification (THYMOS)

These documents provide foundational context for metaphor-driven role architectures and function as resources for future theoretical and implementation work.
